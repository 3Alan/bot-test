  Docusaurus's blogging features are supported by the blog plugin. Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory. You can add regular blog authors to `authors.yml`. The date of a blog post can be extracted from the file name, for example: `2019-05-30-welcome.md` or `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`. Using a folder for blog post images is convenient. Tags are also supported in the blog! If you don't want a blog, simply delete this directory and use `blog: false` in the Docusaurus configuration.

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.
Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.
The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:
- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)

The blog supports tags as well!

And if you don't want a blog: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
